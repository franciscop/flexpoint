# Flexpoint

A utility class library for making grid layouts with flexbox. The main focus is on React, so it has some helpers. Choose **when to change your layout depending on your content** instead of the _device_ you want to show as recommended by [Google's RWD](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/design-and-ui/responsive/fundamentals/how-to-choose-breakpoints), by [Smashing Magazine's Logical Breakpoints](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/03/logical-breakpoints-responsive-design/) and me â˜º

## Getting started

Include it to use in any of your projects:

```
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/flexpoint/2/flexpoint.css
```

To use with React, you can import the main component Flex and then put the class names as props:

```js
// npm i flexpoint
import Flex from "flexpoint";

export default () => {};
```
